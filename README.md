## Data: ATOMIC 2020

The data for ATOMIC 2020 is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uuY0Y_s8dhxdsoOe8OHRgsqf-9qJIai7/view?usp=drive_link). If you need the ATOMIC 2019 data ([Sap et al., 2019](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ATOMIC%3A-An-Atlas-of-Machine-Commonsense-for-If-Then-Sap-Bras/8209a8703d8c48aaca1523cfa307dd1c069e58f3)), it is downloadable [here](https://allenai.org/data/atomic).

## Model: COMET-ATOMIC 2020

Trained COMET-BART model can be downloaded [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/ai2-mosaic-public/projects/mosaic-kgs/comet-atomic_2020_BART.zip).

Trained COMET-GPT2XL model can be downloaded [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/ai2-mosaic-public/projects/mosaic-kgs/comet-atomic_2020_GPT2XL.zip).


## Codebase

We include code used in expirements in COMET-ATOMIC2020 for reproducibility, ease of use. Our models are based off the [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/) codebase, with minor adjustments to adapt the model for our data. Details can be found in the AAAI paper.

### Setup

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install requirements for your Python instance. We recommend [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage Python installs. Our codebases is on Python 3.

It's recommended that you test that your enviroment is set up correctly before running modeling code. You can do this via `python models/comet_atomic2020_gpt2/comet_gpt2.py --test_install`

The code for modeling is located in `mosaic/infra/modeling`. `mosaic/datasets/KGDataset` is used to convert the ATOMIC2020 CSV into an HuggingFace `Datasets` object.

### Directory Overview

`beaker_exp`: Contains files needed to run expirements using `Beaker` (https://beaker.org/) instead of on your local machine.

`human_eval`: Contains HTML files for human evaluation on Amazon MTurk, as described in the AAAI paper.

`models`: Contains additional modeling files to reproduce the GPT2 and BART expirements. `models/comet_atomic2020_bart` contains a README and code to run COMET-BART2020.

`scripts`: Contains additional scripts (e.g. utils.py) used during expirements in the COMET-ATOMIC2020 paper.

`split`: Contains code used to make the test, train, and dev splits of ATOMIC2020 with Stratified Random Sampling.

`system_eval`: Contains code for automatic evaluation of generated entities.
